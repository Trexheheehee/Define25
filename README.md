## Project Details

### Overview
In airline operations, tail assignment refers to the process of assigning specific aircraft (identified by their tail numbers) to scheduled flights over a given period, typically ranging from a few days to several weeks. The goal is to optimize the assignment of aircraft to flights while considering various operational constraints, such as maintenance requirements, crew schedules, fuel efficiency, and passenger demand. Efficient tail assignm

### Problem Statement
The Tail Assignment Problem involves optimizing the allocation of resources or tasks to the "tail end" of a process or system, such as assigning remaining tasks, seats, or resources after initial allocations have been made. The goal is to minimize costs, maximize efficiency, or ensure fairness while satisfying all constraints. This problem often arises in logistics, scheduling, and resource management scenarios.

### Solution
Our solution uses PCA to preprocess flight data, reinforcement learning to optimize flight assignments, and conflict detection algorithms to dynamically reschedule flights, ensuring efficient and conflict-free operations.
